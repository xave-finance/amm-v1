## Overview

HaloDAO AMM is a clone of [DFX](https://github.com/dfx-finance/protocol).

There are two major parts to the protocol: **Assimilators** and **Curves** (formerly Shells). Assimilators allow the AMM to handle pairs of different value while also retrieving reported oracle prices for respective currencies. Curves allow the custom parameterization of the bonding curve with dynamic fees, halting bounderies, etc.

### Assimilators

Assimilators are a key part of the protocol, it converts all amounts to a "numeraire" which is essentially a base value used for computations across the entire protocol. This is necessary as we are dealing with pairs of different values.

Oracle price feeds are also piped in through the assimilator as they inform what numeraire amounts should be set. Since oracle price feeds report their values in USD, all assimilators attempt to convert token values to a numeraire amount based on USD.

### Curve Parameter Terminology

### Major changes from the Shell Protocol

The main changes between our implementation and the original code can be found in the following files:

- All the assimilators
- `Curve.sol` (formerly `Shell.sol`)
- `CurveFactory.sol` (formerly `ShellFactory.sol`)
- `Router.sol`
- `ProportionalLiquidity.sol`
- `Swaps.sol`

#### Changing the term "Shell" to "Curve"

Throughout the repository, the term `Shell` has been changed to `Curve`. For example, `Shell.sol` has been **renamed** to `Curve.sol`, and `ShellFactory.sol` to `CurveFactory.sol`, etc.

#### Different Valued Pairs

In the original implementation, all pools are assumed to be baskets of like-valued tokens. In our implementation, all pools are assumed to be pairs of different-valued FX stablecoins (of which one side is always USDC).

This is achieved by having custom assimilators that normalize the foreign currencies to their USD counterparts. We're sourcing our FX price feed from chainlink oracles. See above for more information about assimilators.

Withdrawing and depositing related operations will respect the existing LP ratio. As long as the pool ratio hasn't changed since the deposit, amount in ~= amount out (minus fees), even if the reported price on the oracle changes. The oracle is only here to assist with efficient swaps.

) external view returns (uint256 curveTokens_, uint256[] memory amounts_)
```

Views how many curve lp tokens will be minted for a given deposit, as well as the amount of tokens required from each asset.

**Note that `_deposit` is denominated in 18 decimals.**

| Name          | Type      |                                                        |
