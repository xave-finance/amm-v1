## Overview

DFX v0.5 is a fork of [shellprotocol@48dac1c](https://github.com/cowri/shell-solidity-v1/tree/48dac1c1a18e2da292b0468577b9e6cbdb3786a4), an AMM for baskets of like-valued pairs. An audit of that protocol was previously done by [Consensys Diligence](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/06/shell-protocol/shell-protocol-audit-2020-06.pdf).

There are two major parts to the protocol: **Assimilators** and **Curves** (formerly Shells). Assimilators allow the AMM to handle pairs of different value while also retrieving reported oracle prices for respective currencies. Curves allow the custom parameterization of the bonding curve with dynamic fees, halting bounderies, etc.

### Assimilators

Assimilators are a key part of the protocol, it converts all amounts to a "numeraire" which is essentially a base value used for computations across the entire protocol. This is necessary as we are dealing with pairs of different values.

Oracle price feeds are also piped in through the assimilator as they inform what numeraire amounts should be set. Since oracle price feeds report their values in USD, all assimilators attempt to convert token values to a numeraire amount based on USD.

### Major changes from the Shell Protocol

The main changes between our implementation and the original code can be found in the following files:

- All the assimilators
- `Curve.sol` (formerly `Shell.sol`)
- `CurveFactory.sol` (formerly `ShellFactory.sol`)
- `Router.sol`
- `ProportionalLiquidity.sol`
- `Swaps.sol`

#### Changing the term "Shell" to "Curve"

Throughout the repository, the term `Shell` has been changed to `Curve`. For example, `Shell.sol` has been **renamed** to `Curve.sol`, and `ShellFactory.sol` to `CurveFactory.sol`, etc.

#### Different Valued Pairs

In the original implementation, all pools are assumed to be baskets of like-valued tokens. In our implementation, all pools are assumed to be pairs of different-valued FX stablecoins (of which one side is always USDC).

This is achieved by having custom assimilators that normalize the foreign currencies to their USD counterparts. We're sourcing our FX price feed from chainlink oracles. See above for more information about assimilators.

Withdrawing and depositing related operations will respect the existing LP ratio. As long as the pool ratio hasn't changed since the deposit, amount in ~= amount out (minus fees), even if the reported price on the oracle changes. The oracle is only here to assist with efficient swaps.

### Description

**RPC_URL**

This is the node address, if you are trying to run your local node, you need to use Alchemyâ€™s endpoint in mainnet. This will start an instance of Hardhat Network that forks mainnet. This means that it will simulate having the same state as mainnet, but it will work as a local development network.

**MNEMONIC**

This is your deployer wallet's mnemonic seed.

*Note:*

When running a local node, your deployer wallet's addresses and private keys will be displayed in your local

**ETHERSCAN_API_KEY**

This will be used for contract verifications

**ORACLES_[BASE]_[QUOTE]**

*e.g ORACLES_USDC_USD, ORACLES_EURS_USD*

These are the Chainlink's oracle addresses for currency pairs, this is used to get the FX rate of the base currency in USD. You can find these addresses in contracts under `/contracts/assimilators` directory

**TOKEN_[CURRENCY]**

*e.g TOKEN_USDC, TOKEN_EURS*

Token addresses for assimilators. You can find these addresses in contracts under `/contracts/assimilators` directory

**ASSIMILATOR_PAIRS**
*e.g EURS_USDC,JCHF_USDC

Used for creating new assimilator and curves, can be single value or comma separated if multiple

**LPT_SYMBOL**
Liquidity Provider Token symbold that will be displayed when a curve is created

**GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS**

Used to transfer ownership of a curve/pool/


**CONFIRM_ALL**

If set to **n**(no), then you will be asked wether you want to proceed or not on every contract deployment, setting this to *y* will proceed and bypass all the confirmation input

Example.

## Quickstart

### Local deployment
0. Update .env for the assimilators that you wish to deploy
```
ASSIMILATOR_PAIRS=EURS_USDC,XSGD_USDC,CADC_USDC
```

1. Deploy core contracts
```
> yarn deploy:local:1
```
2. Deploy assimilators
    - Note, usdc assimilator doesn't need to be deployed again and again, upon curve deloyment, script is just referencing to usdc assimialtor config in `dfx-protocol-clone/scripts/config/usdcassimilator`
    - Deploy assimilators (`ASSIMILATOR_PAIRS` env var)
    ```
    > yarn deploy:local:assimilators
    ```
3. Create new curve and set dimensions
```
> yarn deploy:local:3
```

Deploy everything in one command
```
> yarn deploy:local:all
```

Verify script for public networks (kovan for example)
```
> yarn deploy:kovan:verify
```

### Kovan deployment

0. Update .env for the assimilators & curves that you wish to deploy

1. Update oracle and usdc address of `contracts/assimilators/UsdcToUsdAssimilator.sol`

2. Run the deployment scripts
```
yarn deploy:kovan:1
yarn deploy:kovan:assimilators
yarn deploy:kovan:3
yarn deploy:kovan:verify // (optional)
```

### Adding a new curve

1. Verify that you have `factory_deployed.json` and `assimilators/USDCToUSDAssimilator.json` inside `scripts/config/<network>` diretory. These files are generated from previous deploy.

    Please refer to these confluence pages for the deployed addresses per network: 

    - https://halodao.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HALODAO/pages/137330714/Rewards+AMM+mapping
    - https://halodao.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HALODAO/pages/101023769/Deployed+Contracts

2. Create a new json config for the curve's base assimilator. This file will be placed in `scripts/halo/assimilatorConfigs/<network>`. **IMPORTANT:** this change needs to be merged via a PR so it can be reviewed by another peer.

3. Update .env for the assimilator and curve you wish to deploy.

    - For assimilator config, please refer to `dfx-protocol-clone6/scripts/halo/assimilatorConfigs/[network]/[currency]_USDC.json`
    - For curve config, please refer to `dfx-protocol-clone6/scripts/halo/curve/[network]/[currency]_USDC.json`
    - Assimilator and curve configs must have the same file name

4. Deploy the base assimilator
```
> yarn deploy:<network>:assimilators
```

5. Deploy the curve
```
> yarn deploy:kovan:3
```
